// <!-- Whatâ€™s the difference between window vs document? -->
// Window:-
// The window object is supported by all browsers. It represents the browser's window.

// All global JavaScript objects, functions, and variables automatically become members of the window object.

// Global variables are properties of the window object.

// Global functions are methods of the window object.

// Document:-
// The document object represent a web page that is loaded in the browser.
//  By accessing the document object, we can access the element in the HTML page.
//   With the help of document objects, we can add dynamic content to our web page. 
//   The document object can be accessed with a window.document or just document.
